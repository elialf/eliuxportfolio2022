            due to the two tragedies since March 2020 and October 2020. 
            The progression struggles to proceed because it is interfered with by young men of color 
            resorting to violence than other means as their only purpose. It is due to failure in their academics,lack of opportunities, 
            and loss of hope but disparity in the peekskill community.
          </p>-->

          <!-- Tragedy March 2020 paragraph -->
          <p>The Youth Bureau then called a virtual Town Hall and entitled it, "Healing Forward"
            We then formed a small committee with Ridvan Foxhall, Maria Flores, Dr.Margie Daniels, 
            Pat White and Tuesday Paige McDonald. We worked clsed with Ridvan and she was able to
            secure speaker and training for community men to be mentors to our young men. Memebers of the 
            community worked with their teams to also help reduce Youth violence/substance in the City.

                    <p><a href="Interview with Tuesday McDonald.pdf" class="interview">Intreview with Tuesday McDonald (notes)</a></p>
                    <p>What is Healing Forward? As we interviewed Tuesday McDonald, Healing Forward is an 
                      initiative that came out of a tragedy and originated as a virtual town hall for people 
                      to feel heard and understood. It is a significant change right after the pandemic and the 
                      two tragedies that happened since March and October 2020. It is to heal a community which is a big task. 
                      This initiative is being targeted by youngmen of color who resort to 
                      violence than other means as their only sense of purpose. Mentorship programs were to target these 
                      youngmen of color, to stop the violence happening that will give the initiative a hard time to progress. 
                      Mentorships were their best solution for the Healing Forward process to seek hope.
                      Mentorships was the most promise for the goal of Healing Forward as a part of their pillars 
                      However, these violent acts are being interfered out in the streets with and 
                      causing disparity which will at some extent damage the communityâ€™s reputation.
                      Tuesday felt that the pillers of healing forward intiative was Mentorships This was 
                      most promised in terms of contributing in the intiative goals of healing forward.
                    </p>

                    <p><a href="Ridvan Interview.pdf" class="interview">Intreview with Ridvan Foxhall (notes)</a></p>

                    <p>We learned more about how programming for young kids has a positive impact offered in Peekskill. 
                      Strong programs that are included for the tools to help kids figure out who they are and use what they 
                      have to be capable of doing. That involves children to see core values of justice, empathy and services. 
                      These programs involve families to have their children to be involved to have empowerment to help mentor 
                      younger kids to have vision and be goal driven. Programs that inspire to be mentors that would make the 
                      Peekskill community to help young kids to find what they have. Small organization which does not have the 
                      manpower to recruit mentors. Meaning of manpower is someone who would be dedicated to finding mentors to 
                      reach out to school or the community of Peekskill. Collaboration with the school district and 
                      Youth Bureau would be the advantage to use their experience to find mentors. Era Creative Space has 
                      a process of training applicants to become potential mentors and how to deal, talk and work with kids 
                      in a more mutual respect. Looking for adults who can commit to mentoring the younger people for the 
                      workshops because few mentors can be exhausted which is one of the barriers for its disadvantages.</p>

                    <p>How do we support youngmen? Dealing with the situation, Tony Porter was 
                      invited to have a great space and relationship towards youngmen and had a workshop 
                      for them to be mentored. Empowerment program is another area that can help youngmen on 
                      their biggest obstacle of being mentors and having them be committed. The biggest barriers 
                      are finding mentors to be there or want to commit their time and money.</p>

                      <p>Our discussion and feedback from Ridvan in our developing phase 
                        of the digital platform is to have background checks which will be helpful 
                        for the program. Is it just mentees or mentors or organizations looking for mentors? 
                        Information for applicants should say much more about you and your goals as an organization 
                        and how you work with younger people. There should also be options for parents and organizations. 
                        What do parents want to look for mentors for their children? Parents, guardians, or teachers 
                        must have to sign for younger people under 18 who must have approval. An app that can meet mentors 
                        and know that this is a safe app.</p>



                    <p><a href="Interview with Dr.Mauricio and Dr.Daniels - Copy.pdf" class="interview">Intreview with Dr Mauricio and Dr Daniels (notes)</a></p>
                    <p>During the interview with Dr. Mauricio and Dr. Daniels, our team was on 
                      track on the desired platform we assumed was exactly what they were looking for. 
                      We've learned that Dr. Mauricio has advertised mentorships for the city of Peekskill through 
                      phone contacts, papers, business cards and post-it notes. He then lost track to his potential 
                      applicants who were interested in becoming mentors. Volunteer papers that address background checks 
                      to ensure safety through the embedding process. Embedding processing is important to the safety of 
                      very young individuals so that this is a safe digital platform. Embedding process would mention something 
                      like "Have you been arrested" so it ensures safety between the mentors and students. Will not connect right 
                      away with mentors until parents have approval of the younger students for safety reasons. Connecting with 
                      mentors and students to match and find out who they are and what experiences they have professionally. 
                      What kind of students do they want to mentor? This can be someone who wants to be mentored in their career 
                      to be a chef, lawyer or accountant. A setting for a mentor and student would most likely take place in a 
                      local library to be suited for a session environment. As Dr.Daniels mentions, mentorship applications will 
                      be moving beyond paper to making the application digitized. As we discuss more about the digital platform 
                      of Mentorships, students who graduate from high school, pre college or college students and retired employees 
                      to mentor will help network with other fellow mentors to their success and obtain recognition to find bigger 
                      and better opportunities. This digital platform will benefit connections to networking aspects in which people 
                      gather together in the Peekskill community to contribute and look forward.</p>

        <p>There are not enough mentorship opportunities for young people in Peekskill today,

        </p>
        <p>This lack of opportunity leads to a loss of hope for some young people of Peekskill,

          the Healing Forward initiative will struggle to meet its goals of reducing teen violence in Peekskill.

    <h4>Exploring Ideas</h4>

      <body>

         <p>How we start developing the app by using a UX method called User Journey. 
           User Journey is a process where a person's experience during one session to another using a website or app, 
           consists of a sequential series of actions performed to achieve a particular goal. As if I were the user, 
           I would find this app advertised on the Peekskill website digitally or publicly posted outside around Peekskill.

          This is our sketch to objectively address the problem statement to solve through 
          a visual idea and solution. We borrow ideas from each other.
          Sketchting provides a visual explanation of how the outcome of the 
          problem can be solved. We create conceptual user interfaces to bring 
          ideas on how structured the app or website would look like and be interactive to our users goals. 
          Storyboards will help provide the outcomes of ideas to illustrate the usersâ€™ experience.
          </p>

           <h4>Task and User Flows</h4>

           <img class="UXDevelopmentTaskUserFlow" src="Task Userflow.png" alt=""></div>

      <body>

           <p>Focused on the Mentor onboarding experience. Mapped out all the tasks 
             a user would go through to sign up to become a mentor. Assigned screens that would help the user complete each task.
            As we collaborated with user flow, we took the time on how we would find the app if created. 
            Through our tasks, we develop solutions and design visually to the problems that have 
            barriers and so users have the ability to apply digitally. Then we guide our users to complete tasks 
            and application forms through user flows to complete the application form. As a result, we will 
            deliver the app as an opportunity to become mentors!</p>

            <h4>Wireframing</h4>

            <img class="UXDevelopmentWireframing" src="Wireframing 2.png" alt=""></div>

      <body>

           <p>Wireframing is a way to design a website service at the structural level. 
             With the process of user flow, helps guide users to the task. As we develop and design the application ]
             form through using figma, we connect the layouts through wireframing to structure 
             and make the user flow work as if it is an actual intuitive app. </p>
