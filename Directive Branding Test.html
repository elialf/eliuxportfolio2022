					<body>
						<p>Since COVID-19 has drastically changed our lives, it has separated us from friends and families. 
							It has been harder to connect with the world to not go out while being in quarantine due to the pandemic.
							The problem is defined by the fact that events and meetup groups and especially gyms are closed because 
							COVID-19 has put everyone in their houses to prevent the spread of the virus being in quarantine and 
							not have social lives to experience while staying at home. Without human interaction, there is no 
							sense of community and connections but isolation. The lackluster keeps us away to feel unmotivated and 
							is unhealthy to be isolated in our homes without human interactions. However, apps like Zoom and meetups 
							has given us the opportunities to interact online and maintain our social lives to feel presented. 
							But what about staying in shape and exercising?  The idea came across creating a fitness app that is 
							creating social circles for exercising group. The purpose of developing this app is to have a 
							little human interaction with friends, family and people across the globe that you can meet up 
							online while staying at home exercising together to be in shape and healthy. Brand story is about 								 connecting healthy workouts together with friends and family virtually together. Fitness anytime anywhere.

				<p>Through the process of how I started creating my Brand, I use the images on the right as 
					references to design the desire look of my logo. The color green conveys life of feeling 
					alive and being present. </p>
				<p> Green expresses healing to recover from mental illness of no human interaction 
					from being isolated in quarantine, refreshness of a new feeling or experience and growth 
					as a development to yourself and others growing as a community.

								Background image behind the fonts convey a sense of exploring that I have interpreted. 
								This is also where I obtained the colors from my palette and idea for the Brand's personality. 
								These font pairing suit well with the brand since the personality is about being more outgoing, 
								adventurous and lively social. This bring attention to the audience for individuals who want to 
								maintain healthy social lives and explore the world and meet new people.</p>

							  		<h1>Bebas Neue</h1>
										<p> Bebas Neue is a favorite out there in the design-sphere. It's condensed and clean form makes it 
										excellent to use for headings. The rounded comparison of Bebas to Montserrat makes for a tidy and 
										contemporary pairing. This font can express adventures mood to persuade the audience to go out there 
										and explore the world and discover more to life and experiences. In the case of being in quarantine 
										during a pandemic, it's ironic since we cannot go out. However, you can still attend events to meet 
										people online to at least get out of your comfort zone while at home putting yourself out there. </p>
								
									<h1>Montserrat</h1>
										<p>Can be used in multiple domains such as websites, the publishing world, branding, 
										editorial, logos, print, posters, etc. It is a typeface that can be used basically anywhere 
										because of the geometric and elegant simplicity with nice large x-height. The font suits its 
										subtext for any other brand because it is to show recognition for advertising.</p>
